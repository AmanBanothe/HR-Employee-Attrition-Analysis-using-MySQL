üîç Key SQL Queries and Insights

‚úÖ Attrition Rate by Department

üí° Insight: Departments like Sales or R&D have higher attrition ‚Äî worth deeper investigation.

SELECT Department, 
       COUNT(*) AS Total_Employees,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Attritions,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes') * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS Attrition_Rate
FROM hr_attrition
GROUP BY Department;


‚úÖ Income Group vs Attrition

üí° Insight: Lower income groups show significantly higher attrition.

SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN MonthlyIncome < 3000 THEN 'Low Income'
    WHEN MonthlyIncome BETWEEN 3000 AND 6000 THEN 'Mid Income'
    ELSE 'High Income' END AS Income_Bracket,
  COUNT(*) AS Total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Attritions,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes') * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS Attrition_Rate
FROM hr_attrition
GROUP BY Income_Bracket;

‚úÖ High Risk Attrition Profile (Custom Scoring)

üí° Insight: Employees with low pay, long commute, and overtime are most at risk.

SELECT *
FROM hr_attrition
WHERE MonthlyIncome < 3000 
  AND DistanceFromHome > 10
  AND OverTime = 'Yes';

‚úÖ Job Role + Department Attrition Hotspots

üí° Insight: Focus on specific job-department pairs that drive attrition.

SELECT Department, JobRole,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS Attrition_Rate
FROM hr_attrition
GROUP BY Department, JobRole
ORDER BY Attrition_Rate DESC
LIMIT 5;

üí° More Queries:
- Overall Attrition Rate
- Attrition by Job Role
- Attrition by Age Group
- Impact of Overtime on Attrition
- Attrition by Distance from Home
- Monthly Income vs Attrition (Income brackets)
- Attrition by Department
- Job Role vs Monthly Income
- Attrition by Education Level
- Total Working Years vs Attrition
- Years at Company Grouped
- Performance Rating vs Attrition
- High Risk Employees (Low Income + High Distance + Overtime)
#Advanced analyze
- Which combination of Job Role & Department shows highest attrition?
- Compare average tenure (YearsAtCompany) of employees who left vs stayed
- Attrition Risk Score (Custom Score Calculation)
- Employees with High Performance but Still Left
- Average Income vs Years of Experience (Working Years)
- Attrition by Distance Buckets
- Correlation between Environment Satisfaction & Attrition
- Cohort Analysis: Who joined <2 years ago and already left?
- Are young employees leaving more frequently?
- Employee Retention Ratio by Job Role

üìå Key Insights
- OverTime is a strong attrition driver.
- Low-income and high-distance employees show higher turnover.
- New employees (0-2 years) leave more often ‚Äî signaling onboarding/culture-fit issues.
- Some high-performing, well-paid employees still leave ‚Äî possible job dissatisfaction or leadership gap.
- Helps HR target specific job roles within departments for retention strategies.
- Reveals whether long-serving employees or new joiners are leaving more.
- Use this to segment employees for proactive retention programs.
- Losing top performers is costly‚Äîthis helps flag critical losses.
- Useful for HR compensation benchmarking.
- Helps HR with location-based working policy (WFH/flex commute).
- Poor workplace experience often correlates with employee churn.

‚úÖ Conclusion

Using simple yet powerful SQL analytics, this project uncovers valuable trends hidden in HR data. The goal is to help HR departments identify, understand, and act on attrition patterns ‚Äî improving employee engagement and reducing talent loss.
